# DeepFusion: Multi-Modal Product Intelligence  

## Executive Summary  
E-commerce catalogs are growing fast, and so is the cost of keeping them clean and accurate. Product categorization is still handled by a mix of manual work and basic pipelines that often get it wrong. A mislabeled product doesn’t just sit in the wrong shelf—it means weaker search results, poor recommendations, and frustrated customers.  

DeepFusion tackles this challenge by combining two powerful signals: **product images** and **metadata** (like category labels and attributes). Instead of treating them separately, the model fuses both, giving it a fuller understanding of each product.  

Our experiments show:  
- **Metadata-only model:** ~81% accuracy  
- **Image-only model:** ~85.7% accuracy  
- **Fusion model (images + metadata):** ~86.4% accuracy  

At first glance, the lift from fusion seems modest. But at catalog scale, it means **thousands of products categorized correctly that would otherwise slip through**. For a retailer, that translates directly to fewer manual fixes, better product discovery, smarter recommendations, and lower costs. Even a 1% gain in accuracy can reshape customer experience and bottom-line efficiency.  

In short: **DeepFusion turns product classification from a tedious bottleneck into a scalable, reliable system.**

## Project Objectives  
The goal of this project is to **automate and improve product categorization at scale**. Specifically, we set out to:  

1. **Build strong baselines**  
   - Train separate models on metadata-only and image-only inputs to understand the standalone strengths of each.  

2. **Design a fusion model**  
   - Combine visual and structured product data into a single deep learning system, capturing richer context than either source alone.  

3. **Evaluate effectiveness with business-relevant metrics**  
   - Use accuracy and F1-score to measure not just overall performance, but also robustness across frequent and rare categories.  

4. **Bridge technical results with real-world impact**  
   - Translate even small accuracy gains into practical benefits: reduced manual rework, faster product onboarding, more consistent search and recommendation results, and stronger fraud detection.
